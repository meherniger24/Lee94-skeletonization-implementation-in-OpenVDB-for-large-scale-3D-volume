This repository contains the source code for a full Implementation of Lee94 skeletonization in OpenVDB using the Lee et. al 1994 medial axis thinning algorithm. This skeletonization algorithm is the one used in FIJI, skimage. I have another repository where I rewrote the algorithm in C++ and here I implemented with OpenVDB
